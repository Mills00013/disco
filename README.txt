-- SUMMARY --

The Disco module provides your drab, boring site with a little bit of life.
Through randomly generated inline CSS styles, your site will transform into an
abstract work of art. For those not fond of art, Disco can be used as a punish-
ment for specific users or roles on your site.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

Depending on how mt_rand wants to treat you, sometimes a strong stomach.


-- CONFIGURATION --

  recommended that this is restricted to high-level administrators only.
